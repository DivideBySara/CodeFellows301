# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

**Middleware**

Middleware can be used for more custom routes to make a 1-page app.
First we display all of our GitHub repositories on a page with one route.
Then we use a route with a middleware function in routes.js to display just the repository the
user clicks on. It sounds simple, but I could not get my routes working last
Friday!
