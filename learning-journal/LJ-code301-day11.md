# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

**Environment**

Hooray for less a/c! Hooray for bringing both lunch and dinner to Code Fellows.
I was neither chilled to the bone for the afternoon nor shoving food in my
face when I got home. Somewhere between someone else helping me and me helping
myself, I felt good when I left for the day. Now I have to catch up on my
portfolio.

**Single-Page Applications**

Today we learned about single-page applications, but we don't have one yet.
In fact, the lab's starter code had index.html, new.html, and admin.html. We also
had more controllers for more routes tying the pieces together. Follow the code to
MVC.
