**Each day**

1) Fork day’s github to new local git repository

2) Clone to my own github

3) Search inside starter code folder for todos

**Takeaways**

1) I need to get organized! Starting class without Canvas access has put me behind. It's day 2 and I'm racing to catch up.

2) Dress warmly in the summertime. (It's cold in here. Brr!)

3) Bring my own coffee; Code Fellows has terrible coffee.

**2 magjor assignments:**

1)	Starter code for pair programming – The pull request is what we turn in.

2)	Portfolio
