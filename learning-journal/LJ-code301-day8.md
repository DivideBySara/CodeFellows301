# LJ Code 301 - Day8

**Node.js**

We are writing our websites in full-stack JavaScript thanks to Node.js! Yay!
Backend development is on our portfolios. Strangely, I realize that I have used
Node.js before, but only on the front-end. The code for the backend was largely
provided to us, so I didn't understand how the backend worked. I didn't add the
code to server.js or write its methods.

```app.get()```

and

```app.post()```

now make more sense.

**Coffee & Commuting**

The coffee is the same terrible brand; it didn't change after all, but milk
makes it much better. :-)

And getting a ride from Alana makes my commute better. It's nice to ride with
someone else who commutes across the SR520 bridge. Thanks, Alana!
