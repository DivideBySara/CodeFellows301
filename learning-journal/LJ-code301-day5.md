# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

**Forms**

Today we learned about forms. In fact, we learned more than how to add ```<form>```
and ```<input>``` tags; we also learned how to preview them and send the data
to the DOM on another page. This reminded me of working on Rails projects,
but with Rails, the CRUD scaffold with its associated pages (new, edit, etc.)
are generated automatically when creating the new Rails project. Perhaps I'll
add a new.html page at a later date to my codefellowsportfolio.

**Catching Up**

Just when I think I'm all caught up with work, I see lots of assignments due
this weekend. It's CodeWars for me this weekend!
