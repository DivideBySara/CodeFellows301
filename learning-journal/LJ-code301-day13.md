# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

**Deploying to Heroku**

Deploying to Heroku got complicated because I already had 5 web apps,
and I was collaborating with La. La was a trooper; she hung in there until we
figured out that the partner who deploys has to be the one who has the GitHub
account. Otherwise, Heroku won't update on pushes to the master branch. In fact,
it's not guaranteed that Heroku will update immediately on pushes to the master branch,
so if errors occur, check the deployed source code.
