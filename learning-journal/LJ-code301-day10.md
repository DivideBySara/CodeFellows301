# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

**Functional Programming**

Why use a forEach() when map() is available? Why use a loop when a more
semantic function is available? It's good to know about all of these fun
functions. They make code so much more readable! I do wonder if they take
more processing power, however. Maybe it's a tradeoff.

Applying it to the blog app is easier said than done. One failing function is
blocking my pair, and we haven't gotten it working yet. Hopefully I can refactor
my portfolio more easily.
